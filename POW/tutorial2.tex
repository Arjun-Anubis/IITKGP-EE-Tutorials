\section{Question 1}
\subsection{Part a}
We know that the energy varies as the amplitude squared all other things equal, so we have

$$
E \propto A^{2} \implies E \to \frac{E}{e^2} \implies A \to \frac{A}{e}
$$

Since the decay is exponential, the decary to $\frac{1}{e^2}$ will take twice as long as the decay to $\frac{1}{e}$, so we have

$$
t = 2 \tau = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ s}
$$
\subsection{Part b}
Let the damping coefficient be $\beta$, then we have
$$
\beta t = 1 \implies \beta = 1/t = 1/100 = 10^{-2} \text{ s}^{-1}
$$
and we know $r$ is given by 
$$
r = 2m\beta = 2 \times 0.2 \times 10^{-2} = 4 \times 10^{-3} \text{ kg/s}
$$

\subsection{Part c}
We know that the quality factor is given by $Q=\frac{\omega}{2\beta}=\frac{ \sqrt{ \omega_0^2 - \beta^2 } }{2\beta}$
